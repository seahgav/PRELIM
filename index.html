<h1>Jose Rizal</h1>
<p>
  <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Rizal">José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda</a></strong> (Spanish: [xoˈse riˈsal], Tagalog: [hoˈse riˈsal]; June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896) was a Filipino nationalist, writer and polymath active at the end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. He is considered the national hero (pambansang bayani) of the Philippines.[8][9] An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal became a writer and a key member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement, which advocated political reforms for the colony under Spain.
  He was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution broke out; it was inspired by his writings. Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately approved of its goals which eventually resulted in Philippine independence.

  <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_%C3%BAltimo_adi%C3%B3s">Mi último adiós</a></strong> (English: "My Last Farewell") is a poem written by Filipino propagandist and writer Dr. José Rizal before his execution by firing squad on December 30, 1896. The piece was one of the last notes he wrote before his death. Another that he had written was found in his shoe, but because the text was illegible, its contents remain a mystery.
